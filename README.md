Reason they selected the topic:
NBA statistics are a key metric in terms of evaluating player performance and contribution, which in turn leads to their final goal of winning games and championships.
In other words, generally speaking, higher performance should lead to higher statistics.
Additionally, players tend to be paid based on their perceived value, which can be measured by these statistics.
Our goal is to determine if we can predict the playerâ€™s salaries or salary ranges based on their statistics.
