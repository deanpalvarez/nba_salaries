# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
* We plan on using Python and Pandas to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
* We plan to store our database/files within SQL and/or AWS to be accessed by our Python code.

## Machine Learning
* Sklearn is the Scikit-learn machine learning library for Python. It has many modules, including one for linear regression, which we use here as our model. We will use linear regression since we are trying to predict an outcome (i.e. salary) based on an input(s) (i.e. points)

## Dashboard
* We will use Tableau to present our findings and demostrate whether we were able to predict salaries based on player statistics.
